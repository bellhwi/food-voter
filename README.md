# Pickle: Food Voter App

A fun, collaborative decision-making app to help groups choose what to eat---without the endless back-and-forth.

## Overview

**Problem:** Every group has faced this dilemma---"What should we eat?"

**Solution:** Food Voter lets participants submit menu ideas, then vote on the best one in a structured, turn-based flow.

I built this as a full-stack practice project to improve my skills with **Next.js** and **MongoDB**, while solving a relatable problem with a clean user experience.

## Features

‚úÖ Make a room with a title and deadline

‚úÖ Real-time display of submitted menus and live voting results

‚úÖ Participants submit menus with nicknames

‚úÖ Voting phase starts after all menus are submitted

‚úÖ Automatically shows the winner after voting ends
